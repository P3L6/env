These feeds are broken up as folders would be

This is to take advantage of inoreader.com's OPML subscription feature, which does not support folders

Feeds can be updated here and then inoreader will pick up the changes

inoreader account can be linked with reeder4 for actual viewing

when adding a new folder:
1. go to the import/export/backup settings on inoreader
2. add a new opml subscription
3. use this url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pwxn/env/master/export/rss/<file>.opml`
4. select new folder, use same name as file
5. use full syncronization
6. don't notify when updated

The assorted folder is feeds that dont fit into any particular folder. (misc, other)

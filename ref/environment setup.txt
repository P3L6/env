get these xcode extensions
  https://github.com/pwxn/XcodeKit (duplicate or delete a line in editor)  
  https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode
  https://github.com/StefanLage/XQuit/
  note: when xcode has an update, the UUID of the new version has to be added to the plists for all these plugins. to update, git pull them all and rebuild. that should update the plugins in appSupport/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins. (assuming the new xcode uuids have been committed to the info.plists)
  note: found these plugins with the (https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz) package manager. It became to cumbersome so I stopped using it. can check periodically there for new plugins though.
